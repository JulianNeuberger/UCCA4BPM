A project coordinator and a member of our outside sales staff who are assigned directly to the customer accompany each transaction throughout i.e. until delivery. Regular customer training courses and contacts at trade fair presentations are also used to obtain information to promote customer satisfaction. The EDP supported complaint data bank is called upon as an objective parameter and as a source of information for assessing customer satisfaction. The continuous quality capacity and effectiveness of the quality management system is assessed on the basis of the internal audits. A yearly audit plan that contains all the important information and specifications is drawn up. This plan is agreed upon with the company management. Qualified auditors are available for carrying out the internal audits. The results of the audits and the corrective measures with time limits are laid down in an audit report. The execution of corrective measures is supervised by the authorized quality representative. The regulations for the execution of internal audits are laid down in procedural instructions. The control of the quality requirements of products is ensured by measurements and comparisons with the specifications in the form of tests. Depending upon the requirements the results of the tests are documented and if required are used for further analyses."

The Review Panel remains responsible for reviewing NGEC specification revisions to ensure that revised specifications remain compliant with their respective Requirements Documents. Proposed revisions which are accepted will be incorporated into the version of the specification against which the contract is awarded and serve to create the as built specification for the procurement. Once contract award occurs changes to the specification which occurred during the proposal phase will be presented to the Revision Control and Document Control Coordinators who will make a decision based on the nature of the revisions as to whether or not these revisions should be incorporated into a base specification that would be used for additional procurements or should remain unique to the as built specification for the particular procurement. If it is determined that changes to the base specification are warranted these changes will be submitted as DCRs and be handled using the existing Document Management Urgent Process. It is expected that revisions which have been accepted by the Review Panel during the closed period will also be made to the base specification in parallel."

At the beginning of the final review process the RCC will create a Change Summary that will be routed to the Technical Subcommittee for approval. The Change Summary will provide the TSC Review Panel and NGEC with the relevant information regarding each change. The intention is that all changes in a Change Summary will be voted on as a group though the TSC can vote to reject individual DCRs in the Change Summary. Upon approval of the Change Summary the RCC will forward it to the Review Panel for its review. The purpose of this review is to ensure the changes approved have not inadvertently or negatively affected a document\u2019s compliance with the original requirements document. This step is analogous to the review of a completed specification before approval by the NGEC Board. The Review Panel will provide a recommendation to the NGEC Board to approve or reject the changes included in the Change Summary. Upon completion of the Review Panel review of the Change Summary and issuance of a recommendation for approval or disapproval of certain changes as appropriate the recommendation and Change Summary will be forwarded to the NGEC Executive Board for approval. The NGEC Executive Board has the ability to hold individual DCRs in question aside while still approving or rejecting the remaining package of DCRs included in the Change Summary. The disposition of each submitted DCR will be provided to the originator both approved approved as amended and rejected together with the rationale for amending a DCR or its rejection."

Upon review and discussion of the proposed change to the Requirements Document the TSC can make one of three decisions. If the TSC determines this is not a change it wishes to forward to the Executive Board it will reject the proposed change. At this point the DCR is returned to the DCC who will then report back to the submitter of the DCR as delineated in Appendix B. In addition the AWG will be notified of the rejection. If the TSC agrees in principal with the proposed change but believes more work is needed before the Requirements Document is changed it can send the recommendation back to the AWG for additional work. If the TSC believes that the proposed Requirements Document language just needs some editorial modifications the TSC can either send the language back to the AWG or make the modifications itself. In the case of the latter choice the TSC would then follow the \u201cApprove\u201d path below. If the DCR requires modification at this point the TSC should tell the AWG what is needed to be changed. Depending upon how extensive the changes are the AWG can either edit the language it had previously modified or it can issue a new DCR on the same subject. If the AWG takes this latter action it should send the DCR to the RCC so that it can be properly logged into the change management system records. In addition the author of the original DCR will be notified with the status of the document. If the TSC agrees with the recommendation of the AWG it will vote to approve sending the proposed change to the Executive Committee. The TSC may also vote to amend the recommendation to address shortcomings identified by the full TSC membership. All of the supporting documentation that came with the package to the TSC shall be sent to the Executive Committee along with a summary of the TSC deliberations on the matter including a brief justification for any modifications made by the TSC and the results of the vote to approve the change to the Requirements Document."

Upon approving the proposed change to the Requirements Document or amending and approving the proposed change to address any perceived shortcomings the NGEC will deal with the following tasks. The NGEC will request that the Requirements Document be appropriately changed by Technical Support Staff and then posted on the AASHTO web site along with a brief description of the reasons for any modifications to the proposed change approved by the Executive Committee.

Then based on these requirements which are then bundled and assessed by the product management department a development project is defined. During this preliminary phase the scope of the project is defined and an initial specification written and a risk and market price analysis is then carried out on this basis. The risk analysis subdivides projects into 5 categories from low risk to risky: Runner Minor Repeater Major Repeater Stranger and Alien. The purpose of the categorization is to place more focus on the necessary tasks by the PROLaunch system. During the following Concept Phase the risk analysis is repeated by the project team that has now been established and the market analysis is concretised based on the Market Customer Requirements MCR . In addition a first specification and an initial project plan are drawn up based on a rough concept. Phase 2 features a concrete concept on the content which can result in a first prototype with which the specification is finalized. Where necessary a DFMEA a production assessment and a patent analysis are also carried out and critical quality characteristics and a purchasing strategy are defined. During Phase 3 the product is developed in depth on the basis of the detailed concept and where necessary this is supported by further samples and a detailed planning by the production and purchasing departments. Necessary basics for the implementation such as the selection of materials if applicable a PFMEA testing instructions control plans and tools are defined during this phase on the basis of which any necessary investments are made. For the validation all the basics are rechecked and if necessary they are revised or finalized and production is set up with the installation of all the production and testing facilities installation of routines e.g. KANBAN and training of personnel. The aim is to manufacture a pilot series under series production conditions and their verification for series production release. A successful validation with a pilot series is followed by the market launch with the preparation and furnishing of the necessary training materials and documents. In addition production documents such as control and production plans capacity assessments and PFMEA are finalized. After a successful market launch a development project is closed after an individually determined startup phase. Here all the documents relating to the project are archived and formally filed. Where appropriate the Lessons Learned from a project can also be recorded and filed together with the other documents. In the event of amendments to technical documents due to changes to the specification customer requirements materials or a modified manufacturing process or because of internal external test results they shall be processed in accordance with the specified amendment procedure."

A Requisitioner REQ usually an associate or an authorized Procurement BUYER PT at Cognizant officially initiates the purchase in the Company\u2019s P2P system CAPPS Cognizant automated procure to pay solution . In CAPPS system the requisitioner creates a request for purchase necessary to issue a P.O. in Step 3 by confirming and adding details such as sourcing and funding information special handling instructions and or unique requirements for their facilities and projects. Cognizant formalizes its purchase of your products or services by creating and issuing a purchase order P.O. . You should therefore never fulfill an order until you receive a P.O. or other authorized buying Method which is a Formal Agreement . Your invoice cannot be processed and paid in a timely manner without matching to a P.O. in Cognizant\u2019s CAPPS Catalyst system. The delivery of your products or services marks a transition in the P2P process from purchasing activity to Accounts Payable activity. In Step 4 you deliver the products or services as specified on the P.O. the Cognizant Requisitioner signs for or otherwise accepts delivery of the order or initiates any claims or returns directly with your organization. This will also be formalized in the receipt system. Once your products or services have been received in good order the Requisitioner will receipt the order in Cognizant\u2019s CAPPS ARIBA system or notify their department business POC to receipt the order in the system so that your invoice can be processed and paid in Steps 5 and 6 respectively. The supplier organization should generate an invoice referencing the P.O. number specifications and information matching to the P.O and Bill to & Ship to address on the P.O. and send it directly to Accounts Payable A P . When your invoice is received by A P it is entered into the Cognizant financial CAPPS system matched to the corresponding P.O. and placed in a queue for payment within negotiated terms. Once an EDI and physical invoices are in the queue for payment payment activities completely happen in CAPPS Catalyst. A P personnel physically do the 2 way 3 way match for invoices. Each day CAPPS selects invoices eligible for payment invoices not on rejects hold based on the invoice date and approved supplier payment terms. For invoices related to check payments or advance payments via check thee procurement Buyer or requisitioner should raise a check request in the Cognizant CAPPS Catalyst system and the check is produced for those invoices and is sent to the bank for further steps. By monitoring and resolving unnecessary process exceptions we will be able to reduce the supplier payment issues and administrative burden on their organization as well as on Cognizant."

Furthermore the staff will create a new folder for the year if not already done previously under the directory below and then a subsequent subfolder with the name of the month of the Letting being processed ie: 2012 February . Afterwards they will copy all project folders into this newly created folder all folder names must be the PI # with dash if needed: i.e. 123456 . They will also verify that images are full size. They also have to check the sheet order sheet drawing number and quality by opening all of the PDF images using Bluebeam Revu or the Preview Pane in Windows Explorer. Any sheets that are illegible or missing shall be re submitted by the PM. Sheet order may be corrected easily using Flash Renamer. Also check the file names to ensure they follow the standards file naming scheme. Once QA QC of the electronic files is 100% complete copy entire project folder of PDF files over to the network directory. Rename the original scanned images PDF format in the folders that were copied in step 2 to a format of Contract ID # plus the sheet number i.e. B11739 05 M002 2 0001.pdf . The Flash Renamer software is used to rename all files. PDF images must be converted to TIF images in order to be uploaded to BIDX. They have to create another folder called TIF and subsequent subfolders for each project using the Contract ID\u2019s ie: B12205 06 000 2 . Select each project\u2019s PDF images and open them in MetaPrint. Click the Print icon in MetaPrint and on the File Ftp tab choose 200 for Output Resolution TIFF for Output file type and navigate in the Select save path to where the images will be saved the Contract ID folders that were created in previous step . Create a Zip file of the TIF images in the folder by the name of the Contract ID Number."

The DCC shall as soon as possible forward the DCR to the to the appropriate DCB Technical Subgroup leader for the functional group that is most appropriate for the DCR. If the DCR affects two or more subgroups the DCC will select the most appropriate Technical Subgroup leader and it will be up to that individual to coordinate the DCR review with other affected Subgroups. The Technical Subgroup s will review the DCRs and make a recommendation within two working days of receipt whether to approve approve with amendment or reject each DCR. Once the DCR has been dispositioned by the Technical Subgroup it is returned to the DCC who will then return it to the RCC. If a DCR is rejected at any point in this process the RCC will return the DCR to the DCC or Originator as appropriate. The RCC will forward DCRs that were approved or approved with amendment to the Technical Subcommittee and Review Panel for review. Both groups will have three working days to review the DCR and return it to the RCC. The Technical Subcommittee shall determine how best to obtain a vote on the DCR e.g. by email or by conference call. The Review Panel role is to determine that the change is in keeping with the requirements document for a specification or in keeping with other PRIIA requirements. Panel members shall determine how best to obtain a vote on the DCR. Once approved and determined compliant the RCC will forward the DCR to the Executive Board. The Executive Board will vote on the DCR by email within two working days. After the DCR has been approved by the Executive Board the following activities follow. The RCC will notify the Originator that the DCR has been approved and return the DCR to the originator with the approved wording. At this point the wording in the DCR has the authority of an approved document. The RCC will forward the DCR to Technical Support where it will be incorporated into a Sub Revision of the affected document. Upon receipt of the Sub Revision from Technical Support the RCC forwards it and the DCR as well as any supporting documents if applicable to AASHTO for posting. The Sub Revision will be included in the next periodic revision to the affected document."
