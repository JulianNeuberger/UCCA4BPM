The RCC will be responsible for preparing change summaries and submitting them to the TSC according to a schedule which will provide adequate time for the final review of changes for a document prior to a NGEC Executive Board meeting.
Once the change summary and final review process has begun for a specific revision level of a specific document, no further DCRs will be accepted for that DCR compilation.
DCRs submitted after the final review process has begun for a specific revision level, will be held by the RCC until the review and update process is complete.
The RCC and DCC shall use their judgment and experience to determine the cut-off date to accept DCRs for each document revision cycle.
