The DCC shall determine whether a DCR meets the criteria for Urgent (if not already so designated by the RCC), Major or Minor.
If the originator submitting a DCR believes it should be handled as Urgent, the RCC should be informed of that by the originator.
If the RCC agrees, the RCC has the authority to classify it as Urgent, and the DCR will be handled in accordance with the process outlined below.
The DCC has the authority to approve Minor DCRs.
In the event that it is unclear as to whether a DCR falls into the Major or Minor category, the DCR shall be considered Major.
