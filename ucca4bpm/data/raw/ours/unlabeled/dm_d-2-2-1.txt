Upon receipt of a DCR from the DCC, the AWG shall begin an evaluation of the proposed change.
The AWG may have to reach out to PRIIA Technical Working Groups, or outside agencies for assistance.
At the end of this process, the AWG shall make a recommendation regarding the feasibility of the change requested in the DCR.
If the AWG determines the change requested is not feasible or appropriate, it shall reject the DCR.
At this point the DCR is returned to the DCC who will then report back to the submitter of the DCR.
If the AWG determines that the change requested should be implemented, it shall draft suggested language for modifying the Requirements Document.
In the case of a complex suggestion in which the system/change requires detailed implementation guidance, a draft specification—or existing specification, if available—shall be included in the information sent to the Technical Subcommittee (TSC).
Further, all supporting documentation as developed during its evaluation, will be provided to the TSC.
If the AWG determines it should approve the change proposed in the DCR, it shall determine if the DCR text is satisfactory.
