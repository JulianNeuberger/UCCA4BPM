All DCRs for specifications and documents are sent to the Revision Control Coordinator (RCC).
The RCC is responsible for forwarding the DCR to the appropriate Document Control Coordinator (DCC).
If the DCC receives a DCR that meets the conditions listed in Section D.1, however, a change in the normal DCR handling process must occur.
Rather than forwarding the DCR to the Document Control Board, (s)he shall forward the DCR to the Accessibility Working Group (AWG).
The DCB portion of the DCR form (see Appendix A) shall be used by the DCC to record the forwarding of the DCR.
