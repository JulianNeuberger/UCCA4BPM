Specification revisions which are identified during periods in which participation by the full Technical Subcommittee membership is precluded ("closed" periods, such as during an active procurement, bid evaluation or negotiation) must be initiated in the form of a DCR jointly by the Agencies and States involved in the activity, and submitted to the NGEC Review Panel.
The Review Panel remains responsible for reviewing NGEC specification revisions to ensure that revised specifications remain compliant with their respective Requirements Documents.
Proposed revisions which are accepted will be incorporated into the version of the specification against which the contract is awarded, and serve to create the as-built specification for the procurement.
Once contract award occurs, changes to the specification which occurred during the proposal phase will be presented to the Revision Control and Document Control Coordinators who will make a decision (based on the nature of the revisions) as to whether or not these revisions should be incorporated into a "base" specification that would be used for additional  procurements, or should remain unique to the as-built specification for the particular procurement.
If it is determined that changes to the base specification are warranted, these changes will be submitted as DCRs and be handled using the existing Document Management "Urgent" Process.
It is expected that revisions which have been accepted by the Review Panel during the closed period will also be made to the base specification in parallel.
