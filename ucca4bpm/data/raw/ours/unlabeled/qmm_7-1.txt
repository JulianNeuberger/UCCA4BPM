This organization includes the Customer Centre, where transactions are processed.
A project coordinator and a member of our outside sales staff, who are assigned directly to the customer, accompany each transaction throughout, i.e. until delivery.
Regular customer training courses and contacts at trade fair presentations are also used to obtain information to promote customer satisfaction.
The EDP-supported complaint data bank is called upon as an objective parameter and as a source of information for assessing customer satisfaction.
The continuous quality capacity and effectiveness of the quality management system is assessed on the basis of the internal audits.
A yearly audit plan, that contains all the important information and specifications, is drawn up.
This plan is agreed upon with the company management.
Qualified auditors are available for carrying out the internal audits.
The results of the audits and the corrective measures with time limits are laid down in an audit report.
The execution of corrective measures is supervised by the authorized quality representative.
The regulations for the execution of internal audits are laid down in procedural instructions.
The control of the quality requirements of products is ensured by measurements and comparisons with the specifications in the form of tests.
Depending upon the requirements, the results of the tests are documented and, if required, are used for further analyses.
