The process starts by reviewing the order.
The staff should check if all the requested items are available.
If something is missing, the staff has to inform customer about a potential delay and order the missing products.
In the exceptional case of a discontinued item, the customer should be informed about the not longer available items.
After waiting an average of x days for the delivery, the staff should check again if all products are on store.
If everything is OK, then the staff recollects all products and prepare a package.
The courier is then informed about the pre-processed package.
The courier company informs the client about a potential delay until there are enough human resources to process the delivery.
Then, the package is picked up by the designed driver.
A centralized service decides the best route to deliver all driver's packages.
Once the driver delivers the package, she should update the system so all stakeholders are notified.
