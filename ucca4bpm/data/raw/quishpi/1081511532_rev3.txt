After management indicates that new clients are needed, the marketing team will perform a market analysis and prepare a portfolio presentation.
When they have sent out offers to potential clients the marketing team informs management about the responses.
Management then starts negotiations by sending out a detailed offer to the client.
If the client accepts the offer, management will prepare a contract that will be signed.
Otherwise, management analyzes the reason why their offer failed in order to improve in the future.
